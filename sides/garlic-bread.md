# Buca Garlic Bread


## Ingredients

- one loaf of sweet batard / country style garlic bread (not thin ones like french baguettes)
- 10 cloves of garlic
- 1 chunk of mozarella
- olive oil

- slice the bread in half lengthwise
- brush the olive oil / garlic onto the bread
- slice the mozarella and cover bread
- thinkly slice the remaining garlic and put on top of cheese
- bake in oven (@400) for ~20 minutes -- until cheese bubbles / sliced garlic begins to brown
