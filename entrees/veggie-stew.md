# Veggie Stew

This is a favorite of mine lately. Very hearty. Very filling.

## Ingredients

- ~ 1# tomatoes (preferably dry farmed ... smaller ones that are tasty ... not cherry tomatoes)
    - if not in season, 1-2 cans of stewed tomatoes works
- 1 28oz can white canellini beans
- 1 # maitake mushrooms (if you cant find those ... most 'bunchy' mushrooms work ... e.g. oyster, etc)
- 1-2 heads dino kale
    - chopped into rough pieces (~1" square)
    - if you want to eat the bottom of the stem, cut that section too and keep separate
- 1T fennel seeds (ground)
- 1/2T coriander
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 8 anchovy filets, minced
- rice wine / white cooking wine

## Prep

If you have fresh tomatoes:

- boil water
- cut an 'X' on the top and bottom of the tomatoes
- set aside a bowl of ice water
- boil the tomatoes in small batches until they float
- remove and put into ice bath for ~30s each
- the skins should come off
- remove the skins and retain the meat in another bowl

Or ... just used canned tomatoes.

Then in a big stew pot:

- add the tomatoes to the pot on high heat ... we want to reduce them and get the liquid out
- on the side ... chop the mushrooms into rough pieces and fry (in a cast iron) until well browned ... set aside
- put the kale (not stems) into a separate bowl on high heat and splash
w cooking wine (~1-2 one thousand) ... you want the bottom to have some liquid
	- stir every minute or so
	- remove from heat once they turn bright deep green
	- put the kale _stems_ into the big pot w the tomatoes
	- keep the other kale on the side for now
- fry the garlic in a bit of EVOO, then add to the big pot
- add the spices / fennel / anchovies
	- NOTE - you can chop fennel seed but its hard enough to ruin your knife's
	edge ... its easier to get it powdered or use a mortar and pestle
- add some wine to the big pot
- add the white beans
- once everything is warm in the pot ... give it ~5m w the beans
- add the mushrooms / kale
- simmer for a few more minutes and serve

Again ... goes great w togarashi flakes ... but then again what doesn't?
