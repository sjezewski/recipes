    - cloves
    - garlic minced
- 1/3c kalamata olives pitted and chopped

# Directions

There are a few ways to cook the tuna. Probably depends on hwo hungry you are. 

The slow way:

(bake it)

- get a baking pan thats small but deep (like for banana bread)
- put tuna in there, cover w EVOO (it should be fully covered)
    - add spices
- bake @ 300 for an hour / until the tuna breaks apart easily and is fully cooked

The fast way:

(braise it)

- heat up a pan w oil (non smoking oil like grapeseed)
- sear the tuna on both sides
- turn the heat down
- add spices and cooking wine
- cover and let braise for ~10m till cooked through / tender

Then

- combine / toss w the rest of the ingredients
- salt to taste
- I love adding togarashi (japanese chili) flakes to this dish
