# Spanish Cauliflower

reverse engineered from tapas bar

# Ingredients

- cauliflower (1 head)
- smoked paprika (4 tsp)
- olive oil (2 Tbsp)
- 2 shallots (finely diced)
- 2 cloves garlic (pressed)
- 2 Tbsp red wine (or nutty sherry)
- 2 dates (chopped)
- kalamata olives (1/4c sliced)
- rosemary (~6" stick)

# Instructions

## 1. Prep cauliflower

Wash and cut so that their size is homogeneous. Each piece will be no bigger than a half dollar coin. Put olive oil in a bowl. Stir in cauliflower and smoked paprika.

## 2. Roast

Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees (convection). Roast for ~18 min (rotate once)

## 3. Saute

Add EVOO to pan and add medium heat. Add shallots + garlic. When they start to brown add rosemary, then olives / dates / cauliflower. Make sure hot enough to be browning everything. Add splash of sherry/wine.

Depending on the sherry / wine / dates : olives ratio may need salt.

# Good With

- Balsamic Reduction

# Modifications

- Roasted almonds

Try dry roasting pepper / smoked paprika in pan w almonds before sauteing the other ingredients

- Without olives

It won't be salty enough, so add some ground salt.

- Dates replacement

Tried hoshigaki (dried persimmon) which worked quite well
