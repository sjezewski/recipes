# Garden Pasta

# Ingredients

- 2 zuccini
- 1 yellow onion
- 4 small roma tomatoes (or whatever freshest you can find)
- 1# mushrooms (I prefer crimini)
- 12oz pasta. I prefer farfalle (bow ties) / fusilli (corkscrew) / radiatori (beetles)

For finishing:

- parmesan
- 1-2 meyer lemons
- fresh ground black pepper
- good EVOO

# Instructions

Prep

- Semi-finely chop the onions
- Handwipe the mushrooms (this is important! if they get too wet they will not brown properly)
- Slice the musrooms (~1/8")
- Cut the zuccini lengthwise once, then slice semi thin (~1/8") to make half moon shapes
- Slice the tomatoes into wedges (~6-8 per tomato), and set aside in a bowl mixed w a bit of salt


(This is where you need to make a choice if you're cutting corners or not - see note below. If you are, you'd start the water to boil now for the pasta and add it as soon as its boiling. If you're not cutting corners, the sauteing will take longer and you want to time the pasta to just be done as the sauteing is done)

Saute

- On medium heat, w EVOO as needed
- Start w the onions
- Once they've started to brown,
- Add half of the mushrooms
- (Probably should start the water by now)
- Once they've browned nicely, remove mushrooms + onions and set aside
- Add the other half of mushrooms and brown
- (Probably should start cooking pasta by now)
- Brown the zuccini the same way (in halves)
- Add everything back to the pan, and add garlic and tomatoes

Combine

- Add pasta to pan, stir for a bit
- Serve!

## Finishing

- Shaved parmesan
- Squeeze meyer lemon over top
- Add nice olive oil
- Grind some pepper / salt to taste 

# Modifications

1. Red

- If you want something heartier, its very easy to use the pan you're cooking the pasta in to add red sauce / then all the ingredients together

2. Meat

- This dish is also excellent w the right type of sausage. That sausage's name eludes me. Italian is ok, but my favorite to add is something else (maybe provencal?). If I'm adding meat, I saute it before the veggies.

# Comments

- When I make this, I also make a choice. Am I going to be diligent and spend the time to do it right? (which is delicious), or am I too hungry and going to do it quickly (which is good, but not nearly as good)
- To me, when its great, the veggies are all very well browned and not soggy
- They're added to the pasta at the end, and its delicious
- When I cut corners, the veggies (I'm looking at you zuccini) get soggy and its not as good
- I'd love to figure out a way to cut down the time w/o sacraficing quality

- Also, I notice that if I use canola oil instead of EVOO, I can get a better browning, but its also much easier to burn and the pan is harder to clean
