# Balsamic Reduction

# Ingredients

- 1/2 - 1c balsamic vinegar

# Instructions

1. Flash boil

Heat vingar in small saucepan on very high heat until it has a rapid boil.

2. Simmer

Reduce to low heat. Vinegar should smoke / give off fumes. Check viscosity periodically w spoon - scoop some and turn it over to see if it 'sticks'. If it begins to bubble again, its definitely carmalizing and is done or nearly done. For more tart, cook slightly less (and will have lower viscosity). For sweeter, you want higher viscosity.
