## Spicy Chipotle Rub ##

### Ingredients ###

1/2 T of
- piquin chilis
- dried garlic
- whole black peppercorns
- chipotle pepper

1/4 tsp of
- coriander
- chili powder
- paprika

1/2 tsp of
- course salt

### Instructions ###

1. Use morter & pestle to grind up the piquin/garlic/pepper/chipotle/coriander/chili/paprika
2. Then shave a lime and tangerine, and dice the shavings. Add these to the rub.
3. Add the salt

This is enough to provide a light rub for the surface area of 1lb of meat cut into 5 pieces. For a more dense rub, double the recipe per 1lb of meat.


### Thoughts ###

I like the lime/tangerine ... but it takes some of the absorption out of the rub ... its no longer a dry rub. Perhaps they should be added to the meat separately? Or to the marinade?

This time I tried doing them separately. Instead of 1/2T my proportions were 2tsp. The dry rub went in and was absorbed a lot better. The other benefit of doing it this way was that when I added the citrus zest, a bit got absorbed, but the parts that didn't fell off and didn't make it into the pan (which makes them easier to cook in the pan). Maybe the best thing to do is to add those bits to the marinade. This time it was really 'sneezy' and pretty spicy.
