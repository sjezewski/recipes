# Pesto #

# Ingredients #

- 4c packed basil leaves
- 1c pine nuts
- 1c parmesan
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1/2c olive oil

# Instructions #

- I butcher 1-2 basil plants (e.g. from trader joes) and count whatever that is as '4c' (so its probably basil heavy)
- Puree in food processor
- Add salt when eating to taste
