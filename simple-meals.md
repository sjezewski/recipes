### Roast Veggies

Method:

- heat oven to 400 degrees
- cut up veggies
    - e.g. broccoli, cauliflower, sweet potato, carrots, turnips, potatoes, bell peppers
- toss w EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) ~2T, salt (~1tsp), and any spices you like
- put em in, for ~45-60min ... depending on how browned you like them

Tips:

- I actually find using less oil makes the veggies brown more easily
- I like the 'browned' taste more than oil, so often I'll omit EVOO entirely
- To make veggies cook faster / better / get more brown, make sure to cut them up to maximize surface area
    - that means more smaller pieces
    - you may even want to spread them out over two baking sheets ... that helps more of the 'hot air' get to more of the 'veggie surface' quickly
- If you care about easy cleanup, use tin foil under the veggies, if you don't really care about getting everything off the pan (I don't) then you don't really need it

Pro-Tip:

- [Buy This](https://github.com/sjezewski/recipes/raw/master/images/smoked-paprika.jpg)
- I love using smoked paprika ... it basically tastes like BBQ sauce but isn't unhealthy for you
- My go-to veggie is cauliflower ... roasting cauliflower (and tossing w 2T of EVOO + 1T of smoked paprika) is really really good ... if left to my own devices I'll basically do this everyday
- You can also toss w other spices ... tumeric, powdered ginger, coriander, cumin (though I'd go light on cumin)

Other Notes:

- I'd say my split is prob 80% of the time I roast cauliflower, and the rest roast carrots
- Carrots + turnips + brown sugar are a good combo

### Braised Veggies

Method:

- wash greens (kale, dino kale, chard, etc)
- cut roughly
- in medium pot on stove top, turn up heat medium/high
- put greens in the pot
- add ~1/2c rice wine
- after a minute, stir so that all the veggies are getting some heat
  - kale will get bright green pretty quick
- take it out whenever
    - if you like crunchy, take it out sooner
    - if you don't, cover it, let it cook on lower heat for longer
    - you can cover/add more wine as needed

Tip:

- slice some garlic and throw that in as well
- any cheap filtered sake will do, but I like using [michiu](https://github.com/sjezewski/recipes/raw/master/images/michiu.jpg) which you can find at your local asian food mart

### Rice and Beans

This is a complete protein group and tasty either way.

Rice:

Method:

- add 1c rice to pot
- add 2c water
- turn up the heat till boiling
- then cover, and turn down the heat a bit
- stir every so often
- should take ~10m

Tips:

- some people like washing the grains beforehand ... I usually don't bother
- some people like adding butter to the water, I don't bother
- 1c is enough for about 3 servings usually
- I'll often make 2c so I have some extra rice around ... and I'll re-use old rice (see scrambles below)

Beans:

- heat and eat!
- I prefer black beans and I like adding a bay leaf for something a bit different (pick em out when you're done ... the leaves themselves are not edible)

### Fish

Braised:

- usually cod/tilapia/seabass/tuna
- heat up a pan, add some oil that won't smoke (canola / grapeseed / otherwise you can use butter)
- wash the filet off (this does a lot to reduce 'fishiness' taste)
- throw it in the pan
- I'll add maybe ~1/3 of a beer (whatever is around ... I usually use anchor steam), or you can use rice wine, or any wine really
- You don't need to cover the fish in liquid, you don't want it to boil over
- Cover it, turn the heat down to medium
- Should cook in ~10m ... you can always check w a meat thermometer or cut into it and use your eyeballs

Tips:

- Sometimes I'll add some spices on top of the filet, or throw some rosemary in there
- I love tilapia and cod, which also happen to be cheaper fishes (it's also good not to eat too high up the food chain too often or you risk getting too much mercury) .. so that's what I usually use
- tuna/seabass are great, but pricey, so those I usually do on occasion
- I also have a killer tuna salad recipe if you're so interested, let me know

Marinated:

Method:

- same as above, just marinate the fish overnight
- salmon marinade:
    - thumb of ginger chopped
    - 1/2c rice wine
    - 1/3c soy sauce
    - 2T honey
- citrus marinade:
    - 6limes squeezed (or yuzu juice if you have it ... you can find it at asian food store)
    - 6 cloves garlic chopped
    - 2 shots tequila
- you can use these liquids to do the braising as well

### Eggs

I love eggs. I don't really like scrambled eggs, I like runny eggs. I also like em crispy. For this you need a cast iron.

Method:

- heat cast iron on high heat
- add oil that won't smoke (canola / grapeseed / etc)
- after a minute, once the oil is hot, add an egg or two
- give it a minute, then flip
    - use a spatula,
    - do your best to get under the egg
    - then flip, or at least fold it over
    - if its hard to get under ... you probably need more oil or need to wait for it to cook a tad longer
- this should brown the eggs, but leave the insides pretty soft

Tips:

- I love spicy things w eggs
- Some examples:
    - kimchi
    - hot sauce
    - smoked paprika (ok ... this one really isn't spicy)
    - my home made chile paste

## Methods

### Bake in a pan

Easiest way to make a meal!

![looks good](https://github.com/sjezewski/recipes/raw/master/images/veggies_pan.jpg)

Method:

- heat oven to 400
- get a variety of veggies
- cut them up
- put them in a pan
- add spices
    - I add capers
    - and some EVOO (I usually do a 'two-one-thousand' amount of drizzling on top)
    - and I add coriander or smoked paprika
- bake for ~45m
- in the last 10m or so, crack an egg or two on top

Tips:

- take a whole garlic clove (w the 'skin' on it)
    - 'scalp' it ... cut off enough so that most cloves lose a bit off the top
    - put it in the center of the pan
    - slowly pour ~1-2T EVOO onto the open cloves ... it'll absorb some but not all the oil
    - once you take the pan out, you can squeeze out these cloves to go w the food
    - if you add the garlic, it takes a tad longer to cook ... more like 1hr
- add spices
    - rosemary, etc
- add meat
    - add a chicken breast, and perhaps a bit of wine
    - (too much wine and you probably want to do it in a dutch oven not a cast iron ... or it'll corrode)
- try different veggie combos
	- I usually do: sweet potato / onion / tomato / cauliflower
	- other options:
		- turnip / carrot / tomato / zuccini
		- broccoli / eggplant / cauliflower

### Scrambles


Method:

- heat up cast iron / add high heat oil
- slice up a white onion
    - add to the cast iron
    - once onion is soft, turn heat down
    - if you go 'slow and low' for a long time (~15-20m) you can get real great carmelized onions
    - I'm usually too impatient, do it at high heat, and just make sure to stir a lot
- take day old rice (and any roast veggies leftover)
    - stir fry in the cast iron all together
    - the rice will get a bit crispy
    - you'll want to keep stirring so its not too crispy (though I like that)
- once the rice is crispy / all the food in the pan is heated through
    - add a few eggs on top
    - turn the heat down a bit
    - let the eggs cook on top for a bit
    - then gently 'fold' the rice around
    - the goal is to keep the eggs from touching the cast iron directly
    - this way they stay softer ... and you can even basically keep the yolk soft this way if you want
- when done ... this goes great w kimchi / soy sauce / etc

Tips:

- This is one type I do w is more Japanese style.
- But you can add a bunch of different veggies
    - e.g. adding leeks cooked w rice wine goes great w this
    - but you can add any seared veggies ... just sear them before you add the rice)

### Salad

2 easy ways to make a salad great

Easy dressing:

- ~1/2c EVOO
- ~1/3c red wine vinegar
- ~1T dijon mustard
- 1-2 shallots chopped fine
- mix it up, and add to the salad right before serving

Add cheese / nuts (e.g. cheat):

- a log of goat cheese (chevre) is easy to find ... crumble that in
- add nuts (walnuts, almonds, pine nuts if you're fancy)
- and some fruit (green apple, peaches, dried cranberries)

I have a super awesome kale salad recipe that always impresses. It's not super involved, but it's not simple either. If you're interested, I'll share

### Staples on Staples

I learned recently that folks call this 'macrobiotic' food. I just like it.

Basically I'll do brown rice (lower glycemic index) and some braised greens, and beans of some sort (or lentils) ... and thats 80% of a meal right there. Then I'll fry some eggs, or add fish, and add something to make it tasty. Soy sauce, or one of the sauces I list below.

Some example combos:

- brown rice + kale + lentils + ginger miso oil + egg
- white rice + salmon + black beans
- white rice + pinto beans + roast garlic + eggs + chile paste
- white rice scramble + braised leeks + onions + kimchi

## Flourish

- [togarashi flakes](https://github.com/sjezewski/recipes/raw/master/images/togarashi.jpg)
- ginger miso sauce
    - cut up ginger (~1T)
    - EVOO - ~1/2c
    - 1T miso
- tumeric / olive oil
    - same as above, but replace ginger and/or add tumeric
- roast garlic
    - as a one off I'll do this if I'm roasting veggies
    - works best if after you scalp the garlic, you wrap it in tin foil
    - w the opening at the top
    - then pour in ~1T oil while its partially wrapped ... so that the garlic will absorb it
    - then bake for ~1hr
    - make sure it sits on a pan or the oil could leak
- fried shallots
    - slice real thin
    - heat up EVOO in a sauce pan
    - add shallots
    - watch until start to brown
    - you want to remove as they're pretty brown as they'll keep cooking as long as they're in oil
    - remove shallots from oil w a fork
    - put on top of whatever
- dried seaweed
    - great w eggs / stews / etc
- salsa
    - if you want a recipe ... just ask
- chile paste
    - I have a recipe but it's quite involved ... I'll make you some though ... goes great w eggs
- guacamole
    - if you want a recipe ... just ask
